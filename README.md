# Hi there 👋 I'm Alex Bates!
I am a full-stack web developer with a profound passion for computer science. My journey began at the age of 9 when I first saw Ocarina of Time being emulated on my Dad's computer, and I have been captivated by technology ever since. From emulating games and creating websites to mastering Kubernetes and hosting my Minecraft server on AWS, I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies.

- 🖥️ I have been a hobbyist programmer and web developer since 2017.
- 🏫 I took every computer science class available and served as a computer science TA in high school.
- 🎓 I graduated as valedictorian in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Neumont College of Computer Science.

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, working on my car, and hiking and rock climbing!
